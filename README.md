# randomize
Personal project to practice some frontend techniques. Like React (with Hooks), HTML/CSS, JavaScript and others tools as the project evolves.

## Random Numbers
Draw freely or from your own combinations that can be customized below the draw button.

The numbers will never repeat and you can choose whether or not to include zero.

To make it easier, some presets have been created for e.g. Mega Sena and Loto Fácil.

The result can be copied at the end for easy sharing.

## Group draw
Enter as many names as you wish, by pressing Enter or clicking on the small arrow beside the text field.

The draw can be made with 3 or more names, and the number of groups is limited to a minimum of 2 and a maximum according to the number of people entered.

You can copy the result at the end for easy sharing.

## Jokenpô
...or Rock, Paper, Scissors is a fun alternative to draw lots.

Click on the icon and the draw will be made (the result may repeat itself).

### Developed by Julian Nunes, using HTML/CSS, React, Styled Components, Swal and Pretty Checkbox.
